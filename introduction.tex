\section{About the template}

This Master's thesis template isn't just a pretty face! It also comes with a set of examples on:

\begin{itemize}
    \item How to use glossary definitions, acronyms and nomenclature;
    \item How to include images in different layouts (either using the subimage or the minipage methods);
    \item How to cite from the bibliography (.bib) file;
    \item How to insert pretty contrast boxes for relevant notes;
    \item How insert a formatted piece of code;
    \item How insert a directory tree.
\end{itemize}

Don't forget to read de README.md file with more important information such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item How to build your final pdf document;
    \item How to set up VSCode, the superior IDE (sorry Vim lovers), as local ``Overleaf'';
\end{itemize}

This template follows the guide provided by Técnico on how a Master's thesis should be formatted as per 2022. You can find the guide and a whole lot of gusty info on how to write your thesis \href{https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/education/study-at-tecnico/academic-information/masters-dissertation/}{here}.
